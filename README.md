- **Why does this project interest me?**
<p> As someone who has been passionately playing and following the sport of football all
his life, I believe an making a project like this is something I would really love doing. There
have been countless instances where the only opportunity I have gotten to bond with my dad is 
over football conversations were we have gone on to talk about current players, their statistics
their form for hours and hours. It is something that I truly enjoy because I love football. 
I've had the same joy with my friends as well, and I believe every football enthusiast should 
have the opportunity to delve into such conversations and enjoy to their hearts content, and 
such a system would really help them experience this joy.</p>
